# Google Play Store Analysis
### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from the Google Play Store to gain insights into various dimensions of app performance and user preferences. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle in Excel format and underwent preprocessing to handle missing values. Excel's built-in functions, formulas, and pivot tables were leveraged to calculate summary statistics, trends, correlations, and distributions within the data.

### Data
The dataset used for analysis contains information on app categories, reviews, ratings, pricing, installations, and sizes. Preprocessing steps were taken to clean the data and ensure its integrity for analysis purposes.

#### Analysis
Using Excel's powerful features, the analysis explored different dimensions of the data, including:

App categories
Reviews and ratings
Free vs. paid apps
App installations
App price
App sizes
Various visualizations and charts, such as bar graphs, pie charts, line charts, and scatter plots, were generated to effectively communicate key findings and trends derived from the data analysis.

#### Dashboard
A user-friendly dashboard was designed to consolidate key metrics and visualizations for easy reference. The dashboard layout was organized logically, and interactive elements such as dropdown menus, slicers, and filters were incorporated to enable dynamic exploration of the data.
